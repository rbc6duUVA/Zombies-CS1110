/**
 * Zombie.java
 * 
 * The class representing the Zombie object in the game. This class needs to
 * have some representation of current location, a reference to its target (aka
 * the Human), a speed, and a Rectangle representing its hitbox. It might also
 * help to have variables representing the size of both the Zombie and its
 * hitbox. You should create methods for the following: 1. checking to see if
 * this Zombie's hitbox Rectangle is colliding with any other hitbox Rectangle
 * (either the Human or an obstacle Rectangle) 2. movement (normal movement and
 * what to do if there is a collision) 3. constructors 4. getters/setters 5.
 * anything else you may need.
